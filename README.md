# üß† Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews using Naive Bayes

This project focuses on analyzing product reviews from e-commerce platforms like **Amazon** or **Flipkart** to determine whether the sentiment is **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**.

Built using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and a **Naive Bayes Classifier**, this solution demonstrates the power of machine learning for textual data classification.


## üìå Project Objectives

- Classify product reviews based on sentiment.
- Apply text preprocessing techniques: Tokenization, Stopword Removal, Stemming, TF-IDF.
- Train and evaluate a Naive Bayes Classifier.
- Visualize performance using **Confusion Matrix**, **Accuracy**, **Precision**, and **Recall**.


## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Scikit-learn  
- NLTK  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn


## üîÑ Workflow

1. **Data Loading**
   - Load dataset (CSV format) containing product reviews and sentiments.

2. **Text Preprocessing**
   - Tokenization  
   - Stopword removal  
   - Stemming  
   - TF-IDF Vectorization  

3. **Model Training**
   - Use **Multinomial Naive Bayes** algorithm to train the model.

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall  
   - Confusion Matrix


## üìä Output Examples

- Sample Review: `"The product quality is excellent and delivery was on time!"`  
- Predicted Sentiment: `Positive ‚úÖ`
